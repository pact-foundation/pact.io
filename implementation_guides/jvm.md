# JVM

[Pact JVM](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm) is currently compliant to Pact Specification Version 2.0, and implements some non-standard features coming in 3.0.

Head to the [JVM website](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm) to get started with Pact on the JVM \(Java, Scala, Clojure etc.\).

For a Scala specific implementation, there is [Scala-Pact](https://github.com/ITV/scala-pact) from the folks at ITV. This is Pact Specification Version 2.0 compliant and supports SBT and ScalaTest.

## Getting Started Guide

This [workshop](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-jvm) walks you through an example problem from start to finish, exploring most concepts that Pact supports. It takes approximately 2 hours to complete.
