# Javascript

[Pact JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js) is currently compliant to Pact Specification Version 2.0.

## Quickstart guide

Our [5 minute guide](../5-minute-getting-started-guide.md) is written in JS, this is a good starting point if this is your first experience with Pact.

## Pact JS Workshop

If you'd like to go a little deeper, we have a [workshop](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-workshop-js) that will take 1-2 hours. It goes into all of the key topics, and will take you from a novice to intermediate level understanding.

If you need more information, the [Pact JS readme](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js) has detailed information.
