# Javascript
[Pact JS](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js) is currently compliant to Pact Specification Version 2.0 and the release candidate is up!

There is a [*WIP* Pact Mocha Interface](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-mocha) which extends Mocha's BDD interface with `Pact` specific hooks to simplify test writing - or save you from some boilerplate.

We also have a [roadmap](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) to bring Pact to the most used tools around the Javascript landscape.

Pact JS is currently under active development and are welcoming contributions and feedback. Just [get in touch](http://docs.pact.io/contributing/).
