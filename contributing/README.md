# Contributing

We encourage contribution to any of our libraries, if you see something that should be fixed, simply do the following:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch \(`git checkout -b my-new-feature`\)
3. Commit your changes \(`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`\)
4. Push to the branch \(`git push origin my-new-feature`\)
5. Create new Pull Request

If you would like to see a bigger feature, or see `Pact` implemented in another language, please check out the [Pact specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification) and have a chat to one of us on the [Pact slack team](http://slack.pact.io).

The vision is to have a compatible `Pact` implementation in all the commonly used languages, your help would be greatly appreciated!
