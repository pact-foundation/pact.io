# Pact

### What is Pact?

The Pact family of frameworks provide support for [Consumer Driven Contracts](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) testing.

### Consumer Driven Contracts
A `Contract` is a collection of agreements between a client (`Consumer`) and an API (`Provider`) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

Consumer Driven Contracts is a pattern that drives the development of the `Provider` from its `Consumers` point of view.

**Pact** is a testing tool that guarantees those `Contracts` are satisfied.

### Why do you want to use Pact

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Confidence</th>
    <th>Faster</th>
    <th>Less Error Prone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    Continuously evolve your codebase knowing that Pact will guarantee Contracts are met.
    </td>
    <td>
    No need to setup end-to-end environments. No need for manual testing.</td>
    <td>
    Generation and verification of Contracts are automatically managed by Pact.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I still need [convincing](faq/convinceme.html).

For a JVM specific talk, [Deploy with Confidence!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-79QmIV824) was presented at the April meet-up of [MelbJVM](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Melbourne-Java-JVM-Users-Group/) and at the June meet-up of
[Melbourne Microservices](http://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Melbourne-Microservices/). Slides for the talk [can be found here](media/Pact%20-%20Deploy%20with%20Confidence!.pdf).

For a great explanation of consumer-driven contracts (and Pact!), check out this talk from Atlassian at their 2016 summit: [Verifying Microservice Integrations with Contract Testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6x6XBDf9sQ&feature=youtu.be).

Hear how Soundcloud ["Move Fast and Consumer-Driven-Contract-Testing Things"](https://speakerdeck.com/alonpeer/move-fast-and-consumer-driven-contract-test-things) in their talk from MicroXchg 2017.
