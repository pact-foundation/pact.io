The Pact Broker exposes its API using a HAL browser. The HAL Browser is a Javascript REST client that allows you to navigate through HAL hypermedia responses in a way similar to following links in HTML pages in a normal web browser.

HAL allows you to embed links to documentation in the response, so documentation on usage for each endpoint can be found as you navigate around the responses.
